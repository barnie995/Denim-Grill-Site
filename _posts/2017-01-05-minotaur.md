Minotaur is a simple VM b2r from Vulnhub and was made by [@bull](https://twitter.com/RobertWinkel).

This was an decent VM that taught me a lot by way of new tools and general \*nix magics.

Heads up:  Some of these screenshots may have conflicting times as Ive had to redo some of them due to things appearing behind the console or me spamming console with errant letters.  :D

Let's go I guess?


First went off and tried to find the box's IP address ~

{% highlight sh %} netdiscover -r 192.168.56.10/24 -i eth0 {% endhighlight %}

This gave me the IP of: 192.168.56.223 .

Next mission was to enumerate and find out some basic information about the host ~

{% highlight sh %} nmap -p- -sV -O 192.168.56.223 {% endhighlight %}

This returned:

![NMap Results]({{ "/images/minotaur/nmap.png" | relative_url }} "NMap Results")

Hmmmm, interesting.  What's the website?  

![Port 80 Result]({{ "/images/minotaur/port80.png" | relative_url }} "Port 80")


Well, that's slightly useless. My next immediate thought was to brute force the directories. After chucking the IP into GoBuster (one of the best directory brute forcer tools availible IMO) and using DirBusters' medium directory list it returns /bull .   Let's see what's here and if it's useful.

{% highlight sh %} gobuster -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u 192.168.56.223 {% endhighlight %}

![GoBuster Result]({{ "/images/minotaur/mmmmWordpress.png" | relative_url }} "/bull directory")
Well, thats certainly better.  Oh wait, its Wordpress.  Even better than I thought.

Lets see what I can do with this one.  Chucking the site in WPScan returns some interesting results.
(For the sake of space and so its not massive spam here, I'll omit most results till we get to the interesting ones.)

![WPScan Result]({{ "/images/minotaur/interestingIssues.png" | relative_url }} "WPScan Exploits")

I tried cracking bully with rockyou.txt .  No-go, would take way too long to actually crack.


Looking through the links above, I see that theres a Metasploit module/exploit availible.  I'm guessing that I'm learning Metasploit now.

{% highlight sh %}
msfconsole
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight sh %}
search slideshow_gallery cve:2014
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight sh %}
use exploit/unix/webapp/wp_slideshowgallery_upload
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight sh %}
info
{% endhighlight %}

It was at this point I realised the module needs a username and password and therefore had to abandon this thought and avenue until I procured them.

~Fast forward 1-2 hours later, after trying everything I can think of~

I was feeling pretty stuck and as this is up on VulnHub, I took a peek at a walkthrough by Xerbus.  He used a tool called CEWL and mutates it with Johntheripper.  Let's go learn this tool.

CEWL is an awesome tool that scrapes a website for unique words, places each one on a different line in a JTR formatted file. Once done, you can feed it through John which mutates it and changes it from a small wordlist and expands it.

{% highlight sh %}
cewl --write minotaur.txt http://192.168.56.223/bull
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight sh %}
john --wordlist=minotaur.txt --rules --stdout > minotaur_mutated.txt
{% endhighlight %}

Once I had my John mutated wordlist, it was easy enough to run it through WPScan and hope that it worked.

![Password Cracking]({{ "/images/minotaur/crackedWPPassword.png" | relative_url }} "Password Cracking")

Oh yes, finally I'm making head way on this. Now, I can learn metasploit now.  :D

![Meterpreter]({{ "/images/minotaur/meterpreter.png" | relative_url }} "Meterpreter")

Quick snoop around rewarded me my first and second flags.

First:
![First Flag]({{ "/images/minotaur/firstFlag.png" | relative_url }} "First Flag")

Second Flag:
![Second Flag]({{ "/images/minotaur/secondFlag.png" | relative_url }} "Second Flag")


Shadow file backup....  Hmmmmm, let's look around for things to crack it. UnShadow from John seems to do the trick, let's try this out.

![Password Breaking]({{ "/images/minotaur/crackedPasswords.png" | relative_url }} "Password Cracking")


SSHing into these accounts bags me the third and fourth flags.

Third:
![Third Flag]({{ "/images/minotaur/flag3.png" | relative_url }} "Third Flag")

![Fourth Flag]({{ "/images/minotaur/flag4.png" | relative_url }} "Fourth Flag")

Appears that /root/ is the next flag location. This is the \*nix magic I learnt.  If you run:

{% highlight sh %}
sudo -l
{% endhighlight %}

It lists what commands you can run as sudo.

As it says:

{% highlight sh %}
( ALL:ALL ) ALL
{% endhighlight %}

It means you can run ALL commands under all users and all groups as far as I understand it.

![Final Flag]({{ "/images/minotaur/finalFlag.png" | relative_url }} "Final Flag")

WOOT WOOT. This was a very decent VM that taught me a bunch.  Taught me about CEWL, JTR and Metasploit.  I must say, I am incredibly impressed about Metasploit and the tools it provides.
